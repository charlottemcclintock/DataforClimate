## Questions: 

-   Ben Franklin, "There areÂ **three kinds of people**: those that are _immovable_, those that are _movable_, and _those who move_." People on Brightest are those who move, how do we help them find the people who are **movable**? 
-   Where might we be most likely to succeed in changing laws and policies to prevent further climate destruction?
    -   Where do people believe in climate change?
        -    Where do people not believe in climate change? 
    -   What are the demographics of people who believe/don't believe in climate change?
        -   Race/gender/income?
    -   Among those who believe in climate change, how many people are worried? 
        -   Who are the people who believe in climate change, but are not worried? 
        -   Would these be the best people to target? seems easier to move people from not worried to worried than believe to not believe
        -   Are the people who believe/worry the people who will be affected? 
    -   What level of support will it take to win?
        -   What does "winning" look like?
